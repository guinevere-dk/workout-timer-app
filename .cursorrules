# Project Rules — Phase 1 MVP (DO NOT IGNORE)

## Product Philosophy
- Quiet, steady, non-competitive fitness app
- The character is a rhythm partner, not a coach or judge
- No pressure, no comparison, no gamified aggression

## Core Rules (MUST FOLLOW)
- Time-based workouts ONLY (no reps, no counting)
- White & Black UI, minimal buttons and icons
- No loud colors, no gradients, no celebrations
- No warnings, no popups, no motivational slogans

## Playlist Rules
- There are exactly 3 sample playlists
- Sample playlists are read-only
- Custom playlists must be created by copying a sample
- Max 12 steps per playlist
- Max total duration: 30 minutes
- Min total duration: 3 minutes
- Only 1 running exercise per playlist

## Editing Rules
- Users can add, delete, reorder steps
- Duration can be adjusted by +/- 10 seconds only
- No direct number input
- No save confirmation dialogs (auto-save only)
- Deletion must support Undo (temporary)

## UX Restrictions
- Do NOT show XP numbers
- Do NOT show levels as numbers or ranks
- No comparisons, no streak pressure
- Recommendations: only ONE gentle suggestion

## Implementation Notes
- React Native + Expo
- TypeScript
- Local-first (no backend in Phase 1)
- Prefer simple, readable code over abstractions
